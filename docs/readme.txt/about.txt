  1.                    About ZSNES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ZSNES is a SNES emulator that has been worked on since 1997. Originally
programmed by zsKnight and _Demo_, the project has since then attracted a number
of new developers and contributors.

On April 2, 2001, the ZSNES project was GPL'ed and its source released to the
public. Written in a mixture of x86 assembler, C, and C++, ZSNES currently runs
on Windows, DOS, x86 versions of Linux and FreeBSD, x86 Macintosh computers, and
the Microsoft Xbox.

  2.              About the Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ZSNES Documentation Project was started by RichardC in an attempt to update
and reorganize all of the ZSNES documentation into an easy to read, easy to
access collection. It made its public debut upon the release of ZSNES v1.40.
It is officially available in HTML, CHM, and text formats.

If you have any suggestions or corrections that you would like to submit,
feel free to let us know at our forum on the ZSNES Message Board
[http://board.zsnes.com].

RichardC would like to give a special thanks to Nach and the ZSNES community for
all the help and support that they have given to him and the project.

........................................
   Documentation Writers/Contributors
........................................

Contributors are listed loosely based on their dates of contribution.

RichardC - founder of the ZSNES Documentation Project. First active
    administrator. He had the dirty job of doing the initial conversion
    of the docs into HTML.
Nach - programmer extraordinaire, and knows ZSNES very well. He helps a lot in
    documenting the obscure things we writers don't know about.
LDAWG - updated v1.40 changelog, based on a 2 year summary by Nach, as well as
    another 6 months of developer notes.
kevman - helped with the v1.40 FAQ updates.
xamenus - joined the project shortly after RichardC's initial release, and made
    many grammar fixes and updated the content. Combined the 3 separate,
    port-specific documentations into one. Still contributes some content from
    time to time.
Noxious Ninja - manpage expert. No longer active in the emulation "scene", he
    always had something useful to contribute.
Clements - maintainer of the CHM file. Also assists with coding and content.
AspiringSquire - designer and maintainer of the TXT version of the docs;
    occasionally contributes content. Also an expert with grammar and
    vocabulary corrections.
Jipcy - current active administrator and mark-up chief. Manages and contributes
    to all parts of the docs.
Jonas Quinn - mainly helps in super-optimizing the images.
Deathlike2 - ZBoard tech help expert. Also makes many suggestions/corrections to
    the docs.

Special thanks to Radio. He designed the ZSNES.com main page layout, from which
we stole this design for the HTML docs. Also special thanks to Roman Rudenko,
for finding the elusive "display:inline" fix for floated items in IE.

Also thanks to SnesCentral [http://snescentral.com] for providing some info!

                 Thanks
........................................

All ports of ZSNES use NASM v0.98+, GNU Make, zlib, libpng, and JMAlib to
compile, link, compress, decompress, and execute.

In addition to the above, ZSNES Win uses Visual C++ 2003 (or MinGW), DirectX 8,
UPX, and ManyMouse; ZSNES SDL uses GCC, SDL v1.20, and ManyMouse; and ZSNES DOS
uses DJGPP, CWSDPMI, and UPX.

Thanks to those who produced these fine programs!
