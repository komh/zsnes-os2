  <h2>History</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <p>The following is the history of ZSNES, including the changelogs for every official ZSNES release, and other major events.  ZSNES was first released on October 14, 1997.</p>
    <p>Spanning the releases between <a href="#v0715_asm_only_versions" title="Entry in v0.715 changelog about ASM-only versions">version 0.715</a> and <a href="#v0990_fixed_c_version" title="Entry in v0.990 changelog about no longer needing ASM-only versions">version 0.990</a>, an ASM-only version was offered alongside the normal ASM+C version.  Differences between sister C/A releases are marked as appropriate.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> All changelogs before v1.40 were copied from their original text source inside the ZSNES official release packages.  We edited the old changelogs as little as possible in order to minimize the accidental loss of information.  Therefore, you may find spelling mistakes and formatting differences between different versions.</p>

    <h3>v1.50 - December 22, 2006</h3>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>All Ports:</h4>

      <p>For this release, we spent much time rewriting, porting, and improving many internal subsystems.  ZSNES is a program with over 200,000 lines of source code, and in this release, over 25% of that has been modified; also, around 15% of the assembly has been ported to C.  The upcoming list, while large, can't fully describe the amount of work done and the amount of improvements made.  Be sure to see the readme to find out how to use all the new features.</p>

      <div class="section">
      <h5>Subsystem Additions/Updates/Rewrites/Fixes/Improvements</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Ryan C. Gordon's ManyMouse support added. [Nach, pagefault]<br />This allows the systems compatible with ManyMouse (Windows XP, Linux via evdev if read permission set, Mac OS X) to handle each mouse plugged into the system separately. So now games with two mouse-using devices can be played with 2 players (or 1 player controlling both) on a single PC.<br />Left Handed Mouse Support. [Nach, Deathlike, Jonas Quinn]<br />So lefties can have the buttons for a particular mouse swapped if they so desire.</li>
        <li>Rewrote directory handling system. [Nach, Jonas Quinn, grinvader, Deathlike]<br />The old system, dubbed "ZFile", only kept track of files in a limited manner allowing for many many bugs. The new system, dubbed "ZPath", now tracks files and paths in a clean systematic manner to eliminate all file/path related bugs that have made previous versions annoying. All file handling code is now done in C and has many functions to make it easier for anyone else to jump right into this bit of development. This also allows for many new features to be written, and we wrote quite a few. A debug system has also been added, making it easy to track file issues regardless of the operation system in question.</li>
        <li>ZMV Rewritten - Movie Support. [Nach, grinvader, ipher]<br />Added support for subtitles while playing a ZMV. [Nach]<br />Can now load movies via command line parameter. [Nach]<br />Added parameter to close ZSNES when movie is closed. [Nach]<br />Our movie subsystem - ZMV has been completely rewritten from the ground up. Now features such as rerecording (via states and rewind), appending, mouse recording, Super Scope recording (buggy), chapters, start types, frame count, input compression, among other things are now all supported. Note ZSNES can still load old ZMVs; however, it should be noted that ZMVs are somewhat version reliant and may desync on a version it was not recorded with. Also, most of the new features will not work when using an old ZMV.</li>
        <li>Can now dump ZMVs to AVI and WAV. [Nach, Bisqwit]<br />For years, users have requested being able to convert a ZMV to something else; it is now possible.</li>
        <li>Added IPS multipatch support. Goes from IPS, IP0, IP1, IP2, ..., IP9. [Nach]<br />So you can have IPS autopatching apply more than one to a game loaded.<br />IPS files now loaded from save directory then ROM directory. [Nach]<br />Making it easier for a user to auto patch.<br />Fixed silly mistake with size adjustment of IPS patches. [Nach]<br />So now the very rare broken IPS should work.</li>
        <li>Rewind and ZST code fully merged; rewind should now work where save states do (Fixes rewinding in Super Bomberman games). [grinvader, Nach]<br />Can now use 100 save states instead of 10. [Deathlike, Nach, Jonas Quinn]<br />SRAM is now stored in save states and can be optionally loaded from them. [grinvader, Nach]<br />Can now select how many rewind states you want. [grinvader, Nach, ipher]<br />Can now select how much time is in between rewinds. [grinvader, Nach, ipher]<br />Our state saving subsystem has been completely rewritten (although another rewrite is planned) to fix many bugs that used to be present. With the ZST and rewind code merged, it also means no more issues where one works but not the other. This is also now all done in C, making it easier to deal with, as well as allowing many new features as listed above.</li>
        <li>Parsegen invented (thanks grinvader, gladius). [Nach]<br />Binary and text config files merged into one and heavily updated. [Nach, grinvader, Deathlike]<br />We invented a new programming language (PSR), and a compiler for it (parsegen), which allows one to keep track of variables in a simple manner for both developers and end users. Developers can just declare a particular variable to be tracked and forget about it, letting the system manage everything else, making it easy to add as many configuration options as one likes. For the end user, the config file is all in text, making it easy to modify any feature they like or features for advanced users not changeable from within the GUI. It also provides a level of future compatibility so users should normally not have to delete config files between versions. It also allows partial config files, so users can delete certain settings and have them restored to their defaults. All this is possible while maintaining a high level of flexibility.</li>
        <li>Netplay, Modem, IPX code removed. [grinvader, Nach. ipher]<br />As much as we hated to, we had to remove all computer-to-computer playing options in order to fix up the other subsystems since the code was spread throughout ZSNES. We hope to reimplement it in future versions and also provide new features.</li>
        <li>Created new macros and greatly eased GUI development and cut down on size of GUI code. [ipher]<br />Cleaned up GUI and reorganized it. [ipher, Nach, grinvader, Deathlike, Jonas Quinn]<br />Added tab support to the GUI and made good use of it. [grinvader]<br />Rewrote the load game menu, it can now handle thousands upon thousands of ROMs at a time. [Nach, grinvader]<br />Added a custom font system. [ipher, Deathlike]<br />Nach input boxes (video, path) now have a normal blink rate. [Nach]<br />Now using our custom GUI should be easier and more straight forward. Almost everywhere you look, you should see a cleaner design, new features, and fewer bugs. See below for more specifics.</li>
        <li>New unified ZSNES loader which is also less buggy. [Nach, grinvader, Deathlike, Jonas Quinn]<br />Now command line options are handled in a more efficient manner, as well as making it much easier for us to add more.</li>
        <li>Committed the ZSNES development toolkit. [Nach, grinvader]<br />Code is now always in executable sections, fixes NX and many other issues. [Nach]<br />Added utility to auto detect best -march option to compile with; SDL port uses it automatically. [Nach, grinvader]<br />For various developers, we now added many utilities to make working on ZSNES much easier. Some of these utilities should be built into the assembler but aren't. These new utilities have also allowed us to easily track down several critical bugs and fix them effortlessly. We also have a utility now to aid the person compiling to get the best optimization out of their build, perhaps now allowing them to use HQ4x or other filters that weren't possible before.</li>
        <li>Updated build setups. [grinvader, Nach]<br />Added file dependency utility. [Nach]<br />All the build setups have been updated to make it easier and more flexible for one to compile ZSNES and encounter fewer bugs along the way. File dependencies can now also be calculated automatically (most notably for SDL), so one updating ZSNES doesn't run into weird issues with only half of a fix being compiled.</li>
        <li>Ported much assembly to C. [grinvader, Deathlike, Nach, Jonas Quinn, theoddone33, pagefault, byuu]<br />Removed dead code. [grinvader, Nach, pagefault, Jonas Quinn, Deathlike]<br />Lastly on our big rewrite, a lot of old junk went, and many complex and annoying features are now in C, meaning that if you know C, now is a good time to start helping out ZSNES development.</li>

Overhauled and added much better EHi/Hi/Lo ROM code, improved reset vector, and changed much hard coding to variables. Fixed more SRAM bugs than we can count. Made optimizations to complex loading functions, syntax, memory init (Thanks kode54), execution, and initialization code. Also greatly improved PAL/NTSC detection. Also now has much better chip detection and gives more informative chip names. More games which never loaded before now load properly, such as <em class="game">Dai Kaiju Monogatari 2</em>; it now loads and plays great without the Dejap patch. [Nach]</li>

Fixed 'n' command-line option to allow toggling of 25%/50% in addition to full, also cleaned up the command-line options message and the config file.  Noticed some video modes were way off-centered, fixed that too, should now be perfect.  [stainless] (DOS only)</li>
      <li>Fixed printing of MMX enabled message on the GUI background if you checked MMX SUPPORT under CONFIG -> OPTIONS.  Also, if you check MMX SUPPORT by using the keyboard shortcut it will now attempt to actually detect MMX before enabling it. :)  [stainless, pagefault] (DOS only)</li>

    <h3>zsKnight Leaves - July 23, 2001</h3>

    <p>I'm sorry to say this, but this marks my permanent leave from the ZSNES project, anything related to this, and emulation overall. The reason why is that my dad just passed away today (he died in his sleep, which is strange since he was perfectly healthy yesterday night), so I'm going to have to spend more of my energy devoted to helping my family. My dad is also the main person who provides the finances to the family (since my mom doesn't work), plus I still have about 2 more years to go before I graduate from university, so my immediate future doesn't look that great because with my dad gone, that would mean that I need to put up more responsibility towards taking care of the family instead of studying. But I just hope that everything will go well. Thanks to all you supporters for everything. Sorry for the lack of a proper goodbye though, so I'll probably update once more after I get out of this shock in another day.</p>

      <li>Final Fantasy Mystic Quest works again.</li>
      <li>Fixed Empire Strikes Back crashing bug in the millenium falcon sequence (hopefully this will fix some other games too)</li>
      <li>Removed all self-modifying code in ZSNES.  This will make ZSNES crash a lot less on certain systems, especially during mode 7 sequences.  Thanks Ivar!</li>
      <li>Implemented S-RTC chip, using the system clock as the actual time (The game will make you set the time though, but it will just be replaced with the system time in-game).  Thanks to John Weidman and Dark Force for the info on this chip!</li>
      <li>Fixed crashing bug in certain mosaic scenes (eg. FF3 Phantom Forest) in the new graphics engine</li>
      <li>Fixed a nasty crashing/corruption bug in the new graphics engine (both 8bit and 16bit)</li>
      <li>SPC7110 emulation!  This is based on the information reverse engineered by the hard working folks at dejap translations, Dark Force and John Weidman.</li>

    <h3>Source Code Released - April 2, 2001</h3>

    <p>The ZSNES Sources have finally been released in the CVS repository of the sourceforge page. We also would like to welcome Teuf as a member of the ZSNES team as an assistant coder! He's helped us with quite a lot in the past while, including (but not limited to) setting up the Source Forge page, helping us to write the open source documentation, fixing up the ZSNES sources to not require a custom version of nasm, organizing the sources into directories, modifying the make file, etc. With the sources released, we also hope to release an updated binary soon. Click on the Sourceforge link on the left side of the screen to access the sources. The sources will also be available in a ZIP file for those who don't want to use CVS.</p>

    <h3>v1.17b - December 27, 2000</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>A nasty bug has crept into the DOS version in the 8-bit video modes, so a fixed version (v1.17b) is released (it has the same filename as v1.17 so just overwrite it).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="v117">
    <h3>v1.17, Win v0.85 - December 25, 2000</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Added slow-down key.  You can configure it in Misc -> Game Keys</li>
      <li>Invulnerability bug of the 3rd boss in Demon's Crest in the good checksum roms is fixed through rom mirroring.  I also noticed that this fix is the same as what the author of SNEeSe told me before about on some MegamanX1 roms, but I never had that rom so I never added this until now.  Guess that rom is also fixed too.</li>
      <li>Changed memory initialization values - Lost Viking 2 works again</li>
      <li>65816: Fixed WAI instruction timing with HIRQ's.  Top Gear 2 - 2 player mode works now</li>
      <li>Improved IRQ re-execution timing precision</li>
      <li>Starfox 2 beta now runs with sound!</li>
      <li>Fixed flickering problem in Starfox 2 beta</li>
      <li>Added Mode 2 16x16 tile offset per tile mode</li>
      <li>(Win32) Improved the timestamps on UDP headers.  This should (hopefully) solve those out of sync (where both sides see different things) problems with certain connections (ie. T1/LAN connections) in netplay.</li>
      <li>(Win32) Added a big notice in netplay.txt.  For all of you who used netplay and had poor experiences with a ping time of less than 300ms, read it!  Also added a more realistic system requirements description for decent netplay in netplay.txt rather than a cpu speed estimate.</li>
      <li>Changed reverse stereo method to become invisible to the sound registers in emulation</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="v114">
    <h3>v1.14, Win v0.80 - November 27, 2000</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed configuration files from removing spaces from directory names</li>
      <li>(DOS) Fixed 640x480 vesa2 scanline+interpolation display problem</li>
      <li>(Win32) Improved Windows speed in 32-bit windowed mode.  Should give around an 18% speed increase in FPS.</li>
      <li>(Win32) More netplay improvements.  Shouldn't be as jumpy when one side lacks input.</li>
      <li>(Win32) Starting netplay will now force the max frameskip to 3 if it is less than it and also force on auto frameskip.</li>
      <li>(Win32) MMX optimised netplay with back buffer enabled.</li>
      <li>(Win32) Fixed load state in netplay to load properly instead of sometimes stalling for no reason</li>
      <li>(DOS) Accidently deleted the code to initialize IPX.  Fixed now.</li>
      <li>Fixed a configuration loading problem when loading ZSNES from a different directory.</li>
      <li>(Win32) Attempted to fix those out of sync problems (although I don't know if it's fixed now since those problems rarely happen to me)</li>
      <li>(Win32) Displayed the current filename in the load window for those files with extra long names.</li>
      <li>(Win32) Added nickname support to NetPlay.  There's a 9 character nickname size limit.</li>
      <li>(Win32) Added actions to chat (similar to how mIRC works - use /me &lt;action&gt; )</li>
      <li>(Win32) Nicknames can be changed in the windowed chat by typing /nick &lt;new nickname&gt;</li>
      <li>Added a small buffer to the in-game chat to allow up to 5 chat strings displayed at once.</li>
      <li>Local chat strings now appear in that buffer</li>
      <li>Thickened black borders on the 5x5 font</li>
      <li>Extended in-game chat length by around 30 characters</li>
      <li>Fixed up Interpolation</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="v112">
    <h3>v1.12, Win v0.74 - November 14, 2000</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>(Win32) Hopefully fixed up those green display bugs in scanlines/2xSaI in 1:5:5:5 16bit modes.</li>
      <li>(Win32) Improved lost packet recovery time and reduced the number of lost packet stalls in UDP netplay (should produce more fluid netplay)</li>
      <li>(Win32) Fixed up crashing bug in Tales of Phantasia with a 512 byte header</li>
      <li>Extended filename length of the Quick Menu</li>
      <li>(Win32) Hopefully fixed up the mouse wheel support for certain mice</li>
      <li>Temp .ZIP directory is now cleared if it exists prior to another .ZIP file being loaded.</li>
      <li>(Win32) Improved DirectInput error handling</li>

  <div class="section" id="v111">
    <h3>v1.11, Win v0.72 - November 12, 2000</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>(Win32) ZSNESw won't crash anymore if you don't have a soundcard or if DirectSound fails to initialize.</li>
      <li>(Win32) Fixed a nasty performance bug with certain types of joystick/drivers installed, causing the FPS to be slower for no reason.</li>
      <li>(Win32) Wrote an MMX optimised blitter for 16bit non-D windowed and full screen modes.</li>
      <li>(Win32) Added simple wheel mouse support.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="v110">
    <h3>v1.10, Win v0.70 - November 7, 2000</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed games that turns on the x239 resolution (eg. Chrono Trigger battles) when scanline mode is enabled</li>
      <li>(Win32) Fixed up crashing bugs on extra long filenames with underscores</li>
      <li>(Win32) Hopefully fixed the odd colored interpolation in 1:5:5:5 16bit color settings</li>
      <li>(Win32) Hopefully won't crash anymore when the temporary directory exists prior to unzipping a .zip file</li>
      <li>(Win32) Fixed loading of .zip files with more than 2 '.'s in the filename.  Thanks to DCX for helping us troubleshoot this.</li>
      <li>(Win32) Fixed up short filename saveram/save states loading when the long filename has spaces in it.</li>
      <li>Added TCP/IP Support.  It is recommended that for playable netplay, you'd have an average ping time of less than 300ms (type ping &lt;ip address&gt; in dos) and that packet loss is minimal for TCP/IP (not UDP).  At the moment, you cannot have more than 2 connections.  Thanks for all the testers for testing this, especially DooMStalK, GreenImp, and TeleKawaru!  Also added back buffer support.  This will sacrifice cpu power for netplay to make it much more playable.  WARNING: High cpu speed recommendations (~450mhz+).  Please see netplay.txt for details.</li>
      <li>Added save states to netplay (just use them like you normally do)</li>
      <li>Save Ram is now defaulted to load/save on the server's side Save Ram are not supported in SA-1/SuperFX games due to their size, but you can use save states instead in that case.</li>
      <li>Increased chat line length in the out-of-game chatbox by a lot</li>
      <li>Partly increased the chat line length in-game</li>
      <li>in-game chat text now stays longer on-screen by 2 seconds</li>
      <li>Added reset in netplay</li>
      <li>Fixed up movie recording feature</li>
      <li>(Win32) Mouse shouldn't get stuck on the left side anymore.</li>
      <li>(Win32) Video mode 3 (256x224FS) shouldn't crash anymore.  Thanks to kode54 for his assistance on the above 2 bugfixes.</li>
      <li>(Win32) Fixed the instability bug where the window can sometimes start shaking for no reason and takes away windows resources.</li>
      <li>(Win32) Re-wrote keyboard character input routines</li>
      <li>Fixed up FF2(4)'s music in lower sampling rates</li>
      <li>(Win32) Coded in the UDP protocol as a replacement for TCP/IP.  Some network configurations won't work with UDP.  However, it is strongly recommended that you use UDP if you can because of the speed increase.  In order to disable UDP and use TCP/IP, both sides must de-select UDP.</li>
      <li>(Win32) Added a small multiplayer game list (multi.txt)</li>
      <li>Added an updated Windows FAQ, courtesy of TuxedoMsk of VGNetwork who updated it.</li>
      <li>Added a more user friendly input selection routine (changed Direct Input to Keyb/Joystick and it also auto-sets keyb/Joystick when you set a key)</li>
      <li>Hopefully fixed up the sprite priority problems (eg. FF2/4's damage points)</li>
      <li>(Win32) Added rewind support for up to 8 levels (in 8 second intervals) (NOTE: Windows Port only! - Sorry DOS Port users).  In order to activate this, assign a key to the Rewind Key in the Misc -> GameKeys option.</li>
      <li>Note: Netplay plays really nice as long as the net connection is not unstable, both sides have a fast cpu  (speed requirements depend on the game), and at least have a 28.8 connection.</li>
      <li>*** PLEASE READ ZSNESW.TXT IF YOU ARE STILL HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE WINDOWS PORT</li>

      <li>Fixed crashing problem in MMX2 (Win port)</li>
      <li>Removed clock option (Win port)</li>
      <li>Disabling the new graphics 16bit engine is now properly saved in the configuration files</li>

    <h3>v1.000 - September 1, 2000 - First Windows Release</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Implemented C4 emulation :
        <ul>
          <li>C4 Sprite structure -> OAM conversion routines</li>
          <li>Sprite Rotate/Scale ability</li>
          <li>Sprite disintegrate function</li>
          <li>All in-game used math co-processor functions (hopefully)</li>
          <li>Both wireframe modes</li>
          <li>There are still some problems with C4 emulation, but I'd consider them to be quite minor to just leave them there.</li>
          <li>Thanks to StarCreator for recording a bunch of movies off of the real snes for me to compare!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Tweaked ADSR a bit</li>
      <li>Decreased envelope when key on is issued while sound is still playing.  This fixed static/popping sound bugs that affected many games.</li>
      <li>Added the ability to select the Add-on device (Snes Mouse/Super Scope) from the GUI through the Add-on option in the Config Menu</li>
      <li>Added a hack to allow the mouse to control the cursor in Lethal Enforcers (Press '7' 4 times to activate or select it from the Add-on option in the Config Menu).  Unfortunately, this method has problems (ie. mouse moves things that it shouldn't) but it should be good enough, especially for those who asked for this.  I doubt this works in LE2, however.</li>
      <li>Added a manual load entry box so that you can type in the filenames/directories manually or type in part of the filename and the GUI will seek to whichever filename contains or closely contains that part</li>
      <li>Pharos coded a water effect, getting help from Scott Scriven's water effect code.</li>
      <li>You can enable/disable the Water Effect and Snow Effect from the GUI Options (MISC Menu in the GUI)</li>
      <li>Implemented Sprite Windowing to the new gfx 8bit engine.  This completes all the features that I have planned for that engine.</li>
      <li>Fixed a really nasty stereo bug that caused volume levels/pans to sound completely off on one of the speakers</li>
      <li>Added player 5 as a normal player instead of just being available in modem/ipx play</li>
      <li>Implemented an option to turn in-game messages/fps display to be transparent</li>
      <li>Added a Set Keys feature to the Input Routines in the GUI that allows you to set all of the standard SNES keys all at once instead of clicking on the inputs separately to set them</li>
      <li>Ported the new graphics 8bit engine to 16bit:
        <ul>
          <li>All the standard snes features from the 8bit engine</li>
          <li>Works with all 16bit resolution modes/effects</li>
          <li>Ported high resolution Mode 7</li>
          <li>Added proper main/sub screen support and windowing support</li>
          <li>Added all transparencies modes</li>
          <li>Added Direct Color Mode7</li>
          <li>2xSaI and 50/75% scanlines can now co-exist with high resolution modes</li>
          <li>This is now the default engine for 16bit.  Some games won't work well with this engine such as some SuperFX games (eg. Stunt Race FX in the menus).  You can switch back to the old graphics engine by pressing the '8' key.</li>
          <li>Implemented a dual cache system in the tile modes.  I don't know how much of a speed increase this gives since my system can already run the old graphics engine at full speed and framerate.</li>
          <li>Full 15bit transparencies for MMX cpus only.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>High Resolution Mode7 can be toggled on/off in the Video Options.  It is disabled by default since this feature requires a fast CPU.</li>
      <li>Added 48khz sound sampling rate</li>
      <li>Tweaked VBlank timing  a bit</li>
      <li>Tweaked 65816 CPU cycle execution a bit</li>
      <li>Added Kreed's Super 2xSaI engine.  It's written in C, so it requires a really fast cpu to run it.</li>
      <li>Added picture preview to the save states in the F3 window.  Newly created save states will contain a small picture in them.  Pictures will not appear in old save states, however.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="section" id="v0991">
    <h3>v0.991 - May 24, 2000</h3>

    <ul>

    </ul>

  <div class="section" id="v0990">
    <h3>v0.990 - May 24, 2000</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Added speed hack for Kirby Super Star (US)</li>
      <li>SPC700 (Sound cpu emulation) is now enabled by default whether sound is enabled or not.  Emulation will now be slower than normal if you usually run with sound off, but the compatibility is higher.  However, you can disable this through the options window in the GUI if speed is of your concern.  Also, a few games only run with it disabled so this option may be useful in those cases.</li>
      <li>Decreased cheat code description length by 1 since the last letter was causing some corruption to the next cheat code</li>
      <li>Added an option to raise the pitch level to the pre-v0.989 pitch levels, mainly for non-Creative brand sound cards.</li>
      <li>You can now change the sound settings (Enable Sound, Stereo, Sound Frequency) with immediate effects without re-starting ZSNES.  However, there seems to be some problems with stereo switching on SB Live!'s.</li>
      <li>Configuration is now saved whenever you exit the GUI instead of just exiting the program</li>
      <li>Lots of port preparation done on the source.</li>
      <li id="v0990_fixed_c_version"><strong>Memory/Commandline fix on the C version.  A version should not be needed anymore (hopefully)</strong> </li>
      <li>The GUI is now using the standard in-game video blitter rather than it own.</li>
      <li>Fixed up SnapShot key in 8bit mode</li>
      <li>Implemented 4-point gaussian interpolation.  This is the interpolation used by the actual snes!  Many thanks goes to Neill Corlett for his work on finding this info!  Of course, this routine takes up an extra cpu load so emulation will slow down a bit if your computer isn't fast enough, but you can always disable interpolation through the sound options.</li>
      <li>Fixed up Pitch Modulation method.  Thanks again, Neill!</li>
      <li>Pitch modulation was modulating from the wrong channel.  Fixed.</li>
      <li>Tweaked SuperFX timing.</li>
      <li>Added a move window feature to the F1 menu</li>
      <li>Expanded filename length in the GUI display for long filenames by 3, but had to decrease the directory name by 2.</li>
      <li>Added support for % codes in long filenames</li>

      <li>All sounds were being played at the wrong pitch (slightly higher than normal.  It's now fixed so Zsnes should sound better now.  Thanks to kode54 for helping out here!</li>

    <h3>v0.988c/a - December 6, 1999</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Added some SA-1 speed hacks (Kirby DX/Parodius 3)</li>
      <li>Implemented SDD-1 MMC.  But none of the SDD-1 games run properly yet because of the compression chip.</li>
      <li>Fixed up some slowdown problems in SA-1 games</li>
      <li>Fixed up dirty CPUID fix for Cyrix CPUs so that you don't have to re-run Zsnes twice every time.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="section" id="v0986">
    <h3>v0.986c/a - November 23, 1999</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Re-added Sound Buffering.  I was hoping to re-write it, but later found out that it wasn't worth the trouble.</li>
      <li>Fixed some Triple Buffering bugs, but I can't figure out that flicker glitch on NVidia cards</li>
      <li>Added Simulated Triple Buffering for cards without VESA 3.0 Hardware triple buffering.  This method does some lose frames, but should be faster than v-sync.  This only works on VESA 2.0 modes.</li>
      <li>Fixed up directory sorting to always put ./.. at the top.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="section" id="v0985">
    <h3>v0.985c - November 15, 1999</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Added some more speedups to the SA-1</li>
      <li>SA-1: Fixed a branch problem with the BRL instruction</li>
      <li>Implemented Save Ram support into netplay.  Thanks to The Minder for help testing this!</li>
      <li>Added a hack to get Mario Paint trainered rom with the trainer removed to work with the snes mouse instead of the keyboard/joystick</li>
      <li>Prevented Joystick Keys/Buttons to be selected as the diagonal keys in the GUI</li>
      <li>Fixed some crashing problems with the Modem Mode</li>
      <li>Implemented a key combination editor in the GUI</li>
      <li>Sped up V-Sync</li>
      <li>Fixed an SA-1 memory map bug!  Fixes DBZ:HD.</li>
      <li>Added an small speed hack for DBZ:HD</li>
      <li>Implemented SA-1 Super MMC</li>
      <li>Finally, after many, many hours of hacking.  Figured out what caused the odd noise sounds!  So far, simulated noise is implemented since the true nature of how this noise is produced is unknown so it will sound somewhat off compared to the original sounds.  There is also a slight chance that some sounds will become noise incorrectly and vice versa.</li>
      <li>Fixed up Pitch Modulation</li>
      <li>Fixed SNES Mouse/Super Scope support when Pl3/4 as Pl1/2 option is enabled</li>
      <li>ADSR/GAIN overhaul (Sound DSP) :
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed several GAIN bugs</li>
          <li>Implemented Increase Bentline/Decrease Exp GAIN modes properly</li>
          <li>Rewrote Decay/Sustain modes in ADSR</li>
          <li>Fixed a restarting ADSR bug</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Removed Sound Buffering.  I don't think it's worth losing the quality of the sound for a small amount of speed boost.</li>
      <li>Implemented an option to disable the Noise Simulation for those games that aren't working properly because of it</li>
      <li>Implemented Triple Buffering.  You can enable this through the Video Options in the GUI.  Unfortunately, Triple Buffering won't work with 2xSaI/Super Eagle engine at the moment since they rely on the previous screen for updating nor will it work properly with high resolution games in the old gfx engine. Thanks to GreenImp for patiently helping through testing!</li>
      <li>Implemented Full Screen Interpolation.  Only works on MMX CPU's at the moment.</li>
      <li>Implemented Cheat Code Reflector (See Guinotes.txt for details)</li>
      <li>Any proper VESA 2 error messages now doesn't exit the program when in the GUI but instead display the error message in a box and allows the user to continue.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Daniel for lending me his copier which helped me hack the SNES Sound Noise/ADSR stuff!</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Exit text now only displays when text mode is 80x25</li>
      <li>Used hardware DMA counter to determine which sound block to write to rather than assuming it always starts at the first one for the sound routines.  This should hopefully fix all those nasty sound static problems many people seems to have.  Many thanks to Crono for the code and for his help!</li>
      <li>Removed Re-Init Every 30 Second option.  Shouldn't be needed anymore</li>

      <li>Implemented an option in the sound window to re-initialize the sound card after every 25-30 seconds.  Hopefully fixes the problems where the sound gets staticy after a certain amount of time.</li>
      <li>Newest Save Slot will now appear as orange in the Save State Select (F3) window</li>

      <li>Implemented an option to enable Old Gfx Engine Mode 2 (Accessible through the options window in the GUI).  This mode fixes many transparency problems in 16bit modes, but can also create some and is also at times slower than the original engine.</li>
      <li>Implemented 640x480x65536 VESA 1.2 support.  Currently supports Full Scanlines and Smallscreen modes.  However, it is strongly recommended that you only use VESA 1.2 support if your card cannot support VESA 2.0 (w/ linear framebuffer) since VESA 1.2 runs slower.</li>
      <li>Implemented an option to disable Pitch Modulation</li>
      <li>Sound card is now not re-initialized whenever a state is saved/loaded since some sound cards seems to have problems with it.</li>
      <li>Implemented Single Windowing in the New Gfx 8bit engine, 8x8 and 16x16 tile modes only</li>
      <li>Fixed 64k SRAM support when loaded from the GUI</li>
      <li>Optimised high resolution new gfx modes in 640x480x256</li>
      <li>Fixed the graphic glitches in x488 snes vertical resolution modes in 640x480x256 new gfx mode</li>
      <li>Optimised 640x480x256 Eagle Engine</li>
      <li>Fixed the GUI background display bug in the new gfx engine</li>
      <li>Fixed .SPC capture in the new gfx engine</li>
      <li>Added an option to start with the newest save state when the game is loaded.  It can be enabled in Config->Options window in the GUI</li>
      <li>Slightly optimised new gfx 8bit engine</li>
      <li>Fixed several Mode 7 problems in the New Gfx 8bit engine</li>
      <li>Changed DSP1 variables to use double instead of floats for a small speed increase.  Thanks to Gary Henderson for this tip!</li>
      <li>Fixed up the Mode 7 slowdown bug when the scale ratio becomes small in most graphics modes</li>
      <li>Optimised some Mode 7 transparency modes</li>
      <li>Implemented EXTBG mode 7 into the newgfx 8bit engine</li>
      <li>Fixed the 'FIX' feature in the cheat menu.  Seems like it wasn't writing any value to memory when it was clicked.</li>
      <li>Game Genie codes are now defaulted to the 'FIX'ed mode.  Seems like most of the codes needs this.</li>
      <li>Implemented windowing to Mode 7, New Gfx Engine 8bit</li>
      <li>Added support for .SPC v0.2 format</li>
      <li>Added an option in zsnes.cfg to disable configuration saving for those who want to store zsnes.exe in a read-only storage area</li>
      <li>Fixed GameKeys display in the GUI for certain keys (such as the snes parallel adapter keys)</li>
      <li>Implemented hi-res mode 7 (vertical expand only).  Currently only works in 640x480x256 newgfx engine (w/ Eagle and Scanlines disabled).</li>
      <li>Fixed an offset per tile mode bug in the new gfx 8bit engine</li>
      <li>Implemented dual windowing modes into the new gfx 8bit engine</li>
      <li>New Gfx 8bit engine is now the default graphics engine in 256 color modes.  It still lacks sprite windowing and also has some sprite flicker issues, but it's overall more stable, faster, and has more features.  You can still switch back to the old gfx engine by pressing '8'.</li>
      <li>Looks like Pitch Modulation was causing more sound problems than what it's worth.  It's now disabled by default, but you can reenable it through the GUI.</li>
      <li>Added auto save/load state feature where ZSNES will automatically loads back the previous state when you last properly exited ZSNES.  This feature is disabled by default.</li>
      <li>Compressed the executable using UPX</li>
    </ul>

    <p>*** ADDED A NEW MEMBER TO THE ZSNES TEAM! ***</p>
    <p>Welcome Pharos to the team, his role is currently a coding assitant.  So far, he helped us objectize the zsnes source code which greatly helped in the compile time, provided assembly help, and helped us prepare on linking C code to zsnes (not completely there yet).</p>
    <p>Note : It is strongly recommended to not use the 16-bit new graphics engine yet because of bugs and speed concerns.  It is enabled only in 320x240x65536 for those who are interested.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Added partial 65816 execution in the DMA registers (doesn't seem to fix mucht due to some other problem) Thanks to Alucard for this info!  This also slowed down emulation a bit.</li>

      <li>Implemented mosaic into the new graphics engine</li>
      <li>Implemented true 512 horizontal resolution into new graphics engine (both 16x8 and 16x16 tile modes)</li>
      <li>Implemented interlaced 448 vertical resolution into new graphics engine</li>
      <li>Implemented offset per tile mode into the new graphics engine (Mode 2/Vertical only).  More accurate compared to the old graphics engine. (seems to be a bug where the game gets very slow sometimes though)</li>

      <li>Fixed a sprite window clipping bug where it was used when it's not supposed to be.</li>
      <li>Modified memory allocation technique in zsnes.  This should now eliminate some random crash errors.  Thanks to Y0SHi for this info!</li>
      <li>-c now does full screen instead of small screen in 640x480 modes.  For small screen, use -cc</li>
      <li>Fixed a back area 1/2 addition bug which caused the background to be sometimes darker than usual</li>
      <li>Fixed a mode 7 transparency bug</li>
      <li>Added 8-bit stereo sound and 8-bit sound high speed mode support (high speed mode support is just the implementation of 8bit 44100khz or 22050khz stereo)  Thanks to Crono for a lot of help on this!</li>
      <li>Fixed up sound blaster deinit code.  Thanks again to Crono!</li>

      <li>Added TCALL and PCALL.  Special Thanks to Gary of Snes9X!</li>
      <li>Enabled the debugger (use the -d command line)</li>

    <h3>v0.180 - October 22, 1997</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Move the whats new stuff to readme.txt</li>
      <li>Forgot to remove the end of string marker so the new vesa modes didn't show in the previous version help</li>
      <li>Fixed minor SNES PPU DMA bug</li>
      <li>lowered volume again</li>
      <li>Fixed a vesa 2 bug issue.  Nothing major</li>
      <li>Removed PCALL/TCALL.  If anyone knows the implementation of these instructions, please tell us.  Also, we will not accept any requests to put these back on unless the info the found.  Thanks.</li>
      <li>Modified SPC700 cycle timing.</li>
      <li>Added code that properly deinits sound blaster auto-init mode</li>
      <li>Moved sound blaster interrupt code a bit</li>
      <li>Added Gamma Correction (use -g # in the command line)</li>
      <li>Added what the default keys are in the readme.txt (We should have done this in the first release.  Oh well =) )</li>
      <li>Added a new command line that can modify the % of clock cycles executed.  ZSNES currently is modified so that 100% runs as many games as possible so it is strongly recommended that you do not set this.  But to modify this, use -p # in the command line.</li>
      <li>Hopefully fixed up sprite BG layering priorities and background priorities to the correct way.  Thanks to Y0SHi for this info!</li>
      <li>Fixed up key ordering in zsnes.cfg.  Thanks to Michael and Aquis for reporting this!  If zsnes.cfg already exists, change the button order to : B, Y, A, X, L, R</li>
      <li>Fixed up set blaster detection.</li>
      <li>SPC700 : Fixed up a minor flag setting bug in pop psw</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>v0.170 - October 16, 1997</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed crashing bug when 8000Hz sound is selected (divide by 0 problem)</li>
      <li>Forgot to add code to support Sound Blaster irqs greater than 7</li>
      <li>Changed 65816 timing a bit. (should help compatibility a bit)</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug in 65816 stack routines.  Special Thanks to Alucard for reporting this!</li>
      <li>Somewhat modified sound decompression routines</li>
      <li>Somewhat sped up Mode 7</li>
      <li>Fixed a minor screen add/sub bug in non-repeating mode 7</li>
      <li>Added increment by 8 vram access registers</li>
      <li>Video Modes should now clear the screen when init</li>
      <li>ZSNES now automatically creates a default .cfg file when one is missing</li>
      <li>Forgot to implement save/load state messages in 16-bit.  It's there now.</li>
      <li>Added a new command line : -b.  This disables sound compression buffering.  There is a noticeable slowdown, but this should reduce static.</li>
      <li>Added sound compression buffering disable in the .cfg file.  If you have an old .cfg file already, manually add this string at the end if you want to disable sound buffering : SoundBufDisable = 1</li>
      <li>Added 640x480 modes for both 8 and 16 bit.  VESA2 is still required and these modes are much slower too.  This seems to still not work on various video cards.  There's probabily a bug in VESA2 detection.</li>
      <li>Fixed a sprite layering bug.</li>
      <li>Reduced sound volume to prevent overflows.  This seems to make the sound better, but the pitch calculations are still incorrect due to SPC bugs.</li>
      <li>Fixed a screen sub bug.  Thanks to Barubary!</li>
